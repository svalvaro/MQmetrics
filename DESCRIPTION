Description: The package MQmetrics (MaxQuant metrics) provides a workflow to
        analyze the quality and reproducibility of your proteomics mass
        spectrometry analysis from MaxQuant.Input data are extracted from 
        several MaxQuant output tables, and produces a pdf report. It includes
        several visualization tools to check numerous parameters regarding the
        quality of the runs.It also includes two functions to visualize the iRT
        peptides from Biognosysin case they were spiked in the samples.
